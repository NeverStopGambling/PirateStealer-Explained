# PirateStealer
## My goals when I created PirateStealer
Back in 2020, I had lost my Discord account due to a malware I downloaded on my computer. I guess every vilain has a backstory, and when I lost my account, I wasn't mad nor sad, I was amazed, amazed by how an application, a small 270kb executable file took all my informations. 

I had coding knowledges already, and I wanted to demonstrate to Discord that their application was terrible in term of security, especially using Electron. And was even worst for Exodus, That's how I created the first malware using an injection in Electron to gather informations like a Keylogger. 

My goals never been to infect people nor to make money from it, and the perfect example is that I never used it, and I always gave people contacting me helps & made a malware remover and contributed to most of them, as well as contributing to malware analysis. I was young at that time, 12 when the project started, and really believed in the educational purpose of the malware.

## Do I regret ?
To make it clear, I do not regret a single line of code of PirateStealer. If I wasn't the one who made PirateStealer, it would have been someone else that would have kept the source private, and would have made it harder for malware & security engineers. Of course, some certains things could have gone different (like BBY Stealer taking my source and my research) but I feel like if I wouldn't have created this "malware" which was most a proof of concept than a malware, Discord would have kept on being so unsecure. 

## What would I have done differently ?
Firstly, I did some mistakes, yeah, I was 12 at that time, I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing, so keeping the source working yeah but maybe not building a stub for it. 

## How was the PoC (PirateStealer) working ?
Electron is a JS framework, and as you may know, JS is not a compiled language. Injecting a code was in that case so easy, knowing that it was kept on every startup. So was it for Exodus. 

## Is there gonna be another PirateStealer one day ?
As I said in the beginning of 2023, PirateStealer is dead, no more PirateStealer, and all the news I see relating PS and Gotham are purely fake. Gotham is a whole different project made by people I know, and I respect, but is clearly a private & bad intention malware

## The crazy inactivity of Discord, knowing the vulnerability is still there, I remember publishing a thousand ways, and PoC of how to fix Discord, and not a single fix happened!

I wish to thank Exodus Wallet cause, unlike Discord, they fixed the vulnerability as soon as I reported it to them.

# I have met Great People through this adventure, and by the way, I made 0 single dollars off PirateStealer while other people did stealing my source. At that moment I understood how terrible open-source was, so if I can give you one advice, never do open-source, if you have a good idea, a good project, sell it !

Thank you-
